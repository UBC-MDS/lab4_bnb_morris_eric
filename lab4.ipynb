    "In this lab you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far in 571 and 573 together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. Since this mini-project is open-ended there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you instead do a bunch of sane things and you have clearly motivated your choices, but still get lower model performance than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, the style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"several hours\" but not \"many hours\" is a good guideline for a high quality submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and we hope you enjoy it as well. "

For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",

Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",

    "1. The dataset shows the Airbnb listings in New York City in 2019 with the goal of predicting the number of reviews per month `reviews_per_month` which serves as a proxy of the popularity of the listing. We work with a combination of categorical and numeric features such as the name of the listing, neighbourhood, price, and number of reviews to name a few. Given that the target is numeric, the task will be a regression problem. Being able to accurately predict the number of reviews per month can help hosts identify areas of improvement or perhaps identify regions in the city where there are more popular listings."

    "We are beating the linear model using ensemble models such as LGBM, XGBoost, and random forest. All of these models have a higher cross validation score of around 0.5, compared to the Ridge model's cross validation score of 0.337. We can see that random forest is overfitting the most, with a cross validation score of 0.511 but a train score of 0.931. It is also the model that takes the longest to fit. The gradient boosted tree models LGBM and XGBoost are not overfitting by much, but XGBoost has a higher difference between the train and validation score compared to LGBM."

In general, we can ask domain experts, look at the research paper and so on. Most important is that we can do deep learning method when we have large data set. Additionally, feature selection is also an important step, it helps us to simplify our model. If two models have similar preference, the simple model is preferring to complex model. For example, cross-validated recursive feature elimination help to reduce features that are not important."
